 <h2>Platform fighting</h2>	

A platform fighting game. Got the inspiraton from <em>Super Smash Bros</em> series and any other relative games like <em> Rivals of Aether</em> and <em>Super Smash Flash</em>.

<h3>Intro</h3>

<p>In this game I'll focus more on action design and balance. Like <em>Super Smash Bros</em>, this is a multiplayer game, but you can fight with computer if you like. To keep the goal simple, I'll focus more on the hardcore fighting design, random content like items and will not be my top consideration. There would not be many stories</p>

<h3>Game Structure</h3>
The game would be a typical platform fighting game.  
 - The game contains different environment and dynamic ecosystem, from ground to air.
 - The whole journey is full of different battles. Enjoy the progression of all the spirits you get.
 - Remember you control a team rather than a single character. Use different builds and match up to overcome different battles.
 - Enjoy the story as well as be coutious with your choice. Diffrent decisions would lead to different endings.

But in detailed game mechanics they're totally different. 
 - The collection and cultivation would be easier. I know nowadays players would regard this part as tourture and prefer to skip. Only few spirits requires some luck to meet and capture, others are easy to get, or gifted as the story goes.
 - The story may not be so... suitable for kids. With different choices the tone of story could be totally different. The content would be close to the true fairy tales.
 - Most enemy battles will be based on 6v6, rather than 1 on 1.
 - Battle logic would be kind of differnt. Each spirit would have 5 different skills in battle, four common changable and one ultra. There will be no power point limitation to use different skills. Instead there would be a rage system as main resource to use different skills. Generally the more powerful skills are, the higher is rage consume. To use ultra, you will consume all the rage.
 - Buff and debuff of the basic ability level will remain in one battle, even if you switch the spirit. Mainwhile many spirits have the skill to eliminate your buff in one turn.
 - Status condition would reset once you switch, to speed up the pace in battle.
 - Mark system is the main system in battle. Each spirit would have a series of unique marks to help them in battle. Some may be mild change to some data, like more damage to the skill or receive less damage. Others may change the game mechanic, like gain more rage/ put the spirit to undead status. Every spirit would have unique marks.
 - The design of spirits would be more detailed. Each spirit would have a unique property to change the basic data.
 - Maybe I'll design an online PVP function if time is not limited
 - Talk to me if you want to know more about the outline of the story.
