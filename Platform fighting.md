 <h2>Platform fighting</h2>	

A platform fighting game. Got the inspiraton from <em>Super Smash Bros</em> series and any other relative games like <em> Rivals of Aether</em> and <em>Super Smash Flash</em>.

<h3>Intro</h3>

<p>In this game I'll focus more on action design and balance. Like <em>Super Smash Bros</em>, this is a multiplayer game, but you can fight with computer if you like. To keep the goal simple, I'll focus more on the hardcore fighting design, random content like items and will not be my top consideration. There would not be many stories</p>

<h3>Game Structure</h3>
The game would be a typical platform fighting game.  
 - The health calculation is not decided yet. I’m still hesitating between the traditional health bar like Street Fighter and Super Smash.

 - Chen: the main mechanic in the game. Every character will have a rage bar around the portrait in battle. Each time when you attack and get attacked, the rage bar will accumulate. When you press the special Rage button, a character CHEN of different style will appear around your character, and your character will enter a faster mode like ‘bullet time’, named CHEN, in which you can move obviously faster and start attacks earlier, and may have different interactions with the environment for example in rain you may get hurt when you use CHEN and try to move. Yes you may have the potential to approach the opponent faster and use more different combos, what a horrible advantage in a fighting game. To balance, the opponent will gain a certain amount in Rage bar as well. Once you enter the CHEN mode, the Rage bar consumes. You’ll return to the normal mode when all the rage is consumed.
 - To get more advantage, you may fully accumulate the Rage bar and Enter mode JI, in which your move is at extreme and the world is stopped. But you have to accumulate all the rage, thus the opponent may use CHEN earlier to get advantage. Besides your opponent may enter JI mode together as well. That’s a trade off requires careful consideration.
 - Once you used the JI mode, the rage bar turn dim and you can no longer use rage mode in this battle. Learned this from Samurai Shodown.
 - The characters may interact with Environment in various ways. For example, in Rage modes, when you move in rain you’ll take damage. But you can also hit raindrops to use them as projectiles. There maybe traps in the environment, and they’re all influenced by Rage modes. Gravity exists, which means when using some movement with jump near platforms, you may take huge falling damage. More mechanics are reserved in my notes. 
 - Every character has two different series of move sets, one for normal battle and one unarmed when you lose weapons. Each character has unique action design, unique weapons and even items. Some may be hard to deal with when they have weapons in hand, but lose the advantage when they take shock damage and lose weapon. Others may lack the advantage in weapon, for example using knife. The range and damage is weak, but you can throw them directly to impede the opponent. Besides your unarmed combat move sets could be better than others.
During rage mode, if you take the mortal damage and health bar is totally consumed/percentage is high enough to get smashed, you can continue fighting with health bar accumulate accumulating, just like burn the health to fight. The determination of win and lose will not start until both you and the opponent leave JI mode.
