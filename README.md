As the titled indicated, here is just a general collection of all the idea I have. You can consider it as a simple category. Feel free to view and leave comments

  <h2>Soul mark</h2>	

A simple turn based game... Well actually it's not that simple. Got this inspiraton from <em>Pokemon</em> and<em> Seer </em>series.

> - <em> [Seer](https://seerm.61.com/) </em>is... generally speaking, a copy version of <em>Pokemon</em>. The biggest difference is that this is a mmo game, which makes it easier for kids to play. It's still running nowadays, but the aethetic and design has totally changed, still of poor quality in graphic even comparied with <em>Pokemon</em> Gen9. I highly recommend <strong>NOT</strong> to play it.

> - However, <em>[Seer II](http://seer2.cn/seer2/)</em> is quite different. Even though it's almost a dead game now, the server is still running...by the players. The game used to be ambitious, generated in 2013 but the design of battle system and aethetic is far from old-fashioned. Even today there are still some players stick on it. There is a long twisted story behind. click [here](#S2History) to know more if you're interested.
>> By the way, I've played pokemon Gen6 and 7, but in the end spent more time on [Pokemon Showdown](https://pokemonshowdown.com/). 

<p>Before the time even exists, the world was once a whole. Things started to change when one moment two different powers were born at the same time, who were both regarded as the true devine. The bright <em>Yother</em>, and the shadow <em>Quirce</em>. They fight out of diffrent exsiting concept, till the earth was split into two pieces. After they finally both suffered and destroyed each other, they melt into different spirits and generated all different kinds of life around the ruins of earth. </p>
<p>Since the first human carves the first letter on stone, human beings have been developing the culture and science with the spirit pieces from divine. The time has been peaceful, until someday the spirit from <em>Quirce</em>em> rise up again, and started to revenge <em>Yother</em>.The ground was once again overwhelmed with the smell of battles, and all the splendid architectures were once again destoryed into ruins. The survivors gather together and elected 8 (the number would change according to the elements in game) heros and prayed for the chance to meet with the last spirit of <em>Yother</em>, gained the power to seal <em>Quirce</em> again, saved the world at risk. While the risk is postpone, <em>Quirce</em> still exists. The old prophet, also the last alive witness of all, predicted that <em>Quirce</em> will come back 20 years later. That would be the last chance to eliminate <em>Quirce</em> from this world, as well as his last chance to revenge. Only the chosen kid would be able to succeed the spirit power from <em>Yother</em>, and save the world again.</p>
This is what had happend before the game start, according to human history. 20 years later, you, as the chosen one, showed up and gain the power of <em>Yother</em> unexpectedly, and begins your journey. But tales are tales, history is history. When the trueth is never devulged, the history becomes the future. With the wheels from past begin to move ,same old story will cycle again on this planet...
In the game, you'll play as the chosen hero, who has the power to use the soul from dead annimals and spirits, and has the chance to meet the real past heros. But knowing the truth is not always a good choice, as well as holding the power out of ability. Will you find the true history and save the world, or just speeding up another disaster? The choice is on your hand.</p>

<em>Soul mark</em> would be a turn based battle rpg. In most aspects it derives from <em>Pokemon</em>. 
 - The game contains different environment and dynamic ecosystem, from ground to air.
 - The whole journey is full of different battles. Enjoy the progression of all the spirits you get.
 - Remember you control a team rather than a single character. Use different builds and match up to overcome different battles.
 - Enjoy the story as well as be coutious with your choice. Diffrent decisions would lead to different endings.

But in detailed game mechanics they're totally different. 
 - The collection and cultivation would be easier. I know nowadays players would regard this part as tourture and prefer to skip. Only few spirits requires some luck to meet and capture, others are easy to get, or gifted as the story goes.
 - Most enemy battles will be based on 6v6, rather than 1 on 1.
 - Battle logic would be kind of differnt. Each spirit would have 5 different skills in battle, four common changable and one ultra. There will be no power point limitation to use different skills. Instead there would be a rage system as main resource to use different skills. Generally the more powerful skills are, the higher is rage consume. To use ultra, you will consume all the rage.
 - Buff and debuff of the basicability level will remain in one battle, even if you switch the spirit. Mainwhile many spirits have the skill to eliminate your buffat once.
 - Status condition would reset once you switch, to speed up the pace in battle.
 - Mark system is the main system in battle. Each spirit would have a series of unique marks to help them in battle. Some may be mild change to some data, like more damage to the skill or receive less damage. Others may change the game mechanic, like gain more rage/ put the spirit to undead status. Every spirit would have different marks.
 - The design of spirits would be more detailed. Each spirit would have a unique property to change the basic data.
 - Maybe I'll design an online PVP function if time is not limited
