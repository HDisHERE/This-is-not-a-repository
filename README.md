As the titled indicated, here is just a general collection of all the idea I have. You can consider it as a simple category. Feel free to view and leave comments

  <h2>Soul mark</h2>	

A simple turn based game... Well actually it's not that simple. Got this inspiraton from Pokemon and [Seer](https://seerm.61.com/) series.

> - Seer is... generally speaking, a copy version of pokemon. The biggest difference is that this is a mmo game, which makes it easier for kids to play. It's still running nowadays, but the aethetic and design has been totally changed, still of poor quality in graphic even if comparied with Pokemon Gen9. I highly recommend <strong>NOT</strong> to play it.

> - However, [Seer II](http://seer2.cn/seer2/) is quite different. Even though it's almost a dead game now, the server is still running...by the players. There is a long twisted story behind, click here to know more if you're interested.
>> By the way, I've played pokemon Gen6 and 7, but in the end spent more time on [Pokemon Showdown](https://pokemonshowdown.com/).
