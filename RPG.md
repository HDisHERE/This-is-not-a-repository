<h2>The name was not set yet</h2>	

A traditional role-play game. Honestly I've played various kinds of RPG, it's hard to choose which kind is the best. 
Maybe it's a good idea to add some meta elements like UT.

<h3>Intro</h3>
<p>The most intersting stories are always based on human histories and conflicts behind. Traditional RPG always includes heros and villains to 
help the player immerse into the stories and clearify the goals. But the actual history alwasy warn the humabeings that truth could be simple, but not always simple as it looks. Why there will be the kind and evil, why the empires always make the same mistakes, and why all the wars are decleared with the name of justice, but end with no winner. I wish I could include some of my question and reflection in this game.</p>

<p>In this game I'll only focus on two parts: battles and stories. </p>

<h3>Game Structure</h3>
The battle part would be a typical turn-based game with traditional 45 angle. 

 - There will be various classes, each with different builds and main characters. At the start of the game, when you choose the main character, you also decided the main storyline. Since it's a heavy job, I'll just focus on the easiest one now, the Wild Fighter. More other stories are in my notes.
 - In battles, each character will have a unique skill list, except for the Wild Fighter. You can have at most 5 members in your team, each member will have a single position for pets, thus 10 units in total.
 - Each character will have their own build list to control the parameters. But different classes will have different build preference. For example casters can add more points to strength, to gain the same amount of damage as warriors. But in that case you won't have chance to use magic skills.
 - The battle may start with different limits. There could be solo, team battle, siege or assault.
 - The first class Wild Fighter will share the same skill list as the monsters and animal enemies in the game. The story begins with the wolf boy, who was cultivated by his master several years ago. His life is totally changed with a secret letter from the high king. More details reserved in my notes.
