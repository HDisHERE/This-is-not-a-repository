<h2>The name was not set yet</h2>	

A traditional role-play game. Honestly I've played various kinds of RPG, it's hard to choose which kind is the best. 
Maybe it's a good idea to add some meta elements like UT.

<h3>Intro</h3>
<p>The most intersting stories are always based on human histories and conflicts behind. Traditional RPG always includes heros and villains to 
help the player immerse into the stories and clearify the goals. But the actual history alwasy warn the humabeings that truth could be simple, but not always simple as it looks. Why there will be the kind and evil, why the empires always make the same mistakes, and why all the wars are decleared with the name of justice, but end with no winner. I wish I could include some of my question and reflection in this game.</p>

<p>In this game I'll only focus on two parts: battles and stories. </p>

<h3>Game Structure</h3>
The game would be a typical platform fighting game.  
 - The health calculation is not decided yet. Iâ€™m still hesitating between the traditional health bar like Street Fighter and Super Smash.
