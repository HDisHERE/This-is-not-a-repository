<h2>Kids in Ruins</h2>	

A typical platform adventure game. Got the inspiraton from <em>Mario</em> series and any other relative games, There are too many of them to list exapmles.

<h3>Intro</h3>

<p>A group of kids are accidentally delivered into an island full of garbage. They're all transformed into monsters that reflect their fear hidden in brain.
To go back to their home, they have to work together to survive in this world and face their own psychological trauma</p>

<p>For this game only, I choose to designate the art style. The newspaper clip would be a good choice. 
A good visual style to convey the twisted mind between children and adults. Besides, most of garbage contain the traditional symbol to be an adult, like cigarettes, alcohol bottoles and so on. While the kids are spirite of their favorite friends, like doll, toy tank, flower and baby sets.</p>

<h3>Game Structure</h3>
The game would be a typical platform game.  
 - The health calculation is not decided yet. Iâ€™m still hesitating between the traditional health bar like Street Fighter and Super Smash
