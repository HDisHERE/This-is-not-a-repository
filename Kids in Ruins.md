<h2>Kids in Ruins</h2>	

A typical platform adventure game. Got the inspiraton from <em>Mario</em> series and any other relative games, There are too many of them to list exapmles.

<h3>Intro</h3>

<p>A group of kids are accidentally delivered into an island full of garbage. They're all transformed into monsters that reflect their fear hidden in brain.
To go back to their home, they have to work together to survive in this world and face their own psychological trauma</p>

<p>For this game only, I choose to designate the art style. The newspaper clip would be a good choice. 
A good visual style to convey the twisted mind between children and adults. Besides, most of garbage contain the traditional symbol to be an adult, like cigarettes, alcohol bottoles and so on. While the kids are spirite of their favorite friends, like doll, toy tank, flower and baby sets.</p>

<h3>Game Structure</h3>
The game would be a typical platform game.  
 - In different levels you'll control different characters. They all share the same basic actions like run, jump and step on enemies to kill, but have minor difference in parameters. Someone may run faster and others could jumper higher, etc.
 - Besides, each character has a unique skill to interact with the world. For example the main character is Coffe Cup, who runs a bit faster and could jump further. He can carry some liquid in head, or float in air when head is empty. TV head just looks like the abandoned garbage, so when he crouches the enemy would ignore him, while he can't move in that situation. Sunflower could stick the root to the wall to get easier wall jump, and even walk on the roof upside down.
